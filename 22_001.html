        <p class="standard">To gain as much confidence as possible in one’s own codebase, software tests are a good idea. Tests are small programs that run automatically over the codebase without user control and use rules to show that sections of the code behave as specified. Of course, software can’t show the absence of errors, but a test case always shows whether a program meets the requirements of the specification.</p>

        <p class="standard">Although software testing is extremely important, it’s not terribly popular among software developers. One reason is that tests cost time, which must be spent in instead of pursuing actual development work. If the actual software needs changing, test cases often must be modified as well, so ultimately, you’re managing two construction sites 
            <a id="p1068"/>
        at once. Since developers should always complete a feature as soon as possible, testing is often dropped from the agenda. Another reason is that some developers think they are infallible coding gods, who consider all their program code (after a few hours of debugging) to be absolutely correct, performant, and delightful.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">How can such a skeptical group now be convinced to write tests after all? A big advantage of automated testing is that, when major changes are made to the source codebase (i.e., refactoring), your test cases automatically tell you if everything has been changed correctly. After refactoring, for example, for a performance optimization, the tests report an error, something has probably been “optimized” in the wrong way. Software is subject to permanent change and is never finished, a sufficiently compelling argument for testing because, when software has reached a certain size, what effects changes to the source codebase will have is unpredictable. In addition, another reason exists for dealing with tests: One positive side effect of testing is that the generated software is significantly better by design because writing testable software, although tricky, almost inevitably results in better design. And a better design is always desirable because it increases comprehensibility and makes customizing the software later much easier.</p>

            <p class="standard">The focus of software testing is on three characteristics: automatic, repeatable, and traceable. These characteristics require a library that must support two things:</p>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Test cases always look the same and consist of three steps. First, a scenario is developed, then the method or a combination of methods to be tested is called, and finally the specific application programming interface (API) of the testing framework determines whether the executed program has shown exactly the desired behavior. This process is taken over by some sort of “is it true that” methods that match the desired state with the actual state and throw an exception if a conflict exists. In the event of an error, the tests should document exactly what went wrong.</p>
                
                </li>
                
                <li>

            . In addition, other tests will be required, such as load tests, performance tests, and integration tests, but these topics don’t play a major role for the purposes of our book.</p>
