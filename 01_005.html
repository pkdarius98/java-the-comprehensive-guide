            <p class="standard">Java SE is a system environment for the development and execution of Java programs. Java SE contains everything needed to develop Java programs. Although the terminology is somewhat fuzzy, Java SE can be understood as a specification rather than an implementation. However, for Java programs to be compiled and executed, a concrete compiler, an interpreter, and the Java libraries must be installed on your computer. Different implementations of Java SE exist, such as OpenJDK.</p>

                <p class="standard">On May 23, 1995, Sun introduced Java to the general public for the first time. A lot has happened since then, and in each version, the Java library has been expanded. Nevertheless, hardly any incompatibilities exist from one version to the next, and almost 100% of what was compiled under Java

                    <span class="italic">upward compatibility</span>

                <h4 class="t4" id="h1.5.1.3">Feature Release versus Time-Based Release</h4>
                
                <p class="standard">For 20 years, features determined the release of new Java versions: Developers put certain innovations on the wish list, and when all features were implemented and tested, the 
                    <span class="italic">general availability (GA)</span>
                 took place. The main problem with this feature-based approach model was the delays associated with implementation issues. The Java 9 release was much discussed because it should definitely contain a module system.</p>
                
                <p class="standard">Oracle responded to these issues and to the Java community’s desire for more frequent releases with “JEP 322: Time-Based Release Versioning.”
                    <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn01_21" id="fn01_21">[ 21 ]</a></span>
                 Four releases are planned per year:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>
                        
                        <p class="standard first-item last-item">In March and September, major releases (such as Java 10, Java 11, Java 12, etc.) are published.</p>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        
                        <p class="standard first-item last-item">Updates appear 1 month after a major release and then at 3-month intervals.</p>
                    
                    </li>
                
                </ul>
                
                <p class="standard">In other words: Updates occur every 6 months, which allows Oracle to further develop the language and libraries and to integrate new language features in our fast-moving IT world. If delays occur, these problems don’t immediately stop the entire release. Java 10 was the first release on this schedule in March 2018.</p>

                <p class="standard">The first Java versions were Java 1.0, Java 1.1, and so on. With Java 5, the prefix “1.” was dropped from the product’s version identifier, so it was simply called Java 5, Java 6, etc. In developer versions, however, the notation with the “1.” remained valid until Java 9.
                    <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn01_22" id="fn01_22">[ 22 ]</a></span> In Java 10, a vendor identifier was added with 
                    <span class="italic">time-based release versioning</span>, so that alternatively to Java 10 and Java 11 also Java 18.3 and Java 18.9 were mentioned—in Java 12, Oracle dropped this 
                    <span class="italic">vendor version string</span> again.

            <p class="standard">With 
                <span class="italic">Java Card</span>,
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_104"/> Oracle has defined a standard for Java-like programs on smart cards (such as SIM cards). However, Java’s language standard is somewhat limited. The output of the Java compiler is a bytecode similar to the standard bytecode. This bytecode is then executed on the 
                <span class="italic">Java Card Virtual Machine</span>, which is placed on the smart card. However, since vastly different memory requirements may exist for such a tiny system, the runtime environment is not comparable to the standard JVM. Java Card lacks threads and lacks automatic garbage collection. Differences also exist in the libraries. Not only are many well-known classes missing, but conversely, strong cryptographic algorithms are included in the package, and of course a package that allows the card application to communicate with the outside world is also included. In addition to the standard Java Card 3.0, editions exist, such as the 
                <span class="italic">Classic Edition</span> and the 
                <span class="italic">Connected Edition</span>
            . The Connected Edition no longer has many restrictions and also now has threads and automatic garbage collection.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">With the standard Java Card, bringing programs onto cards from different manufacturers is easy—as long as the card complies with the standard. Before Java Card, this compliance was always a bit difficult because each map vendor used different APIs and tools, and the map was usually programmed in a dialect of C. Nowadays, Oracle doesn’t pay much attention to Java Card.</p>

            , the reference implementation for Jakarta EE) is handled by an application server.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Over the past few years, parts of Jakarta EE have migrated to Java SE, such as JAX-WS (web services), JNDI (directory service), or JAXB (object XML mapping). These APIs are 
                <a id="p66"/>
            now standard and are no longer seen as just part of large enterprise applications. In Java 11, things took a step back again, and technologies such as JAB were removed from Java SE for development independently.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">The first version of Jakarta EE dates back to 1999, when it was called 
                <span class="italic">J2EE</span>. Some buzz around Jakarta EE has grown in recent years. For a long time, Sun, then Oracle defined the standard. Then, things went quiet, and Oracle failed to establish a lightweight alternative that optimally supported microservices and container virtualization. This lack strengthened alternative enterprise frameworks like 
                <span class="italic">Spring</span> (Boot). Then, in September 2017, Oracle announced it was dropping Java EE—around the same time as the Java EE-8 release—leaving it in the hands of the Eclipse Foundation, which named it 
                <span class="italic">Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J)</span>. However, Oracle was against the use of the name “Java,” so the final name is 
                <span class="italic">Jakarta EE</span>
            . Today, the Eclipse Foundation is one of the most important organizations that further develop Java standards and solutions in a vendor-neutral manner.</p>

                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_108"/>
            </h3>
            
            <p class="standard">While Java ME runs programs on devices with reduced memory and limited processing power, this says nothing about the responsiveness of the runtime environment to external events. When a sensor in the bumper of a car reports an impact, the runtime environment can’t be stuck in a memory cleanup operation for 20 milliseconds before the event is processed and the airbag deploys. To close this gap, the Java community defined JSR 1, the 
                <span class="italic">“Real-time Specification for Java” (RTSJ</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_109"/>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_110"/>
                <span class="italic">)</span>
            , early in 2001. (JSR 282 is the successor to RTSJ 1.1.)</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Real-time applications are characterized by the fact that a maximum deterministic wait time may block the system from, for example, automatic garbage collection to respond to changes in sensors. A real-time system should guarantee a response time, which is something a normal VM can’t do. The reason is two-fold: The time for automatic garbage collection is rather indefinite in normal runtime environments, and other actions of indefinite duration have been added. For instance, if Java loads a class, it does so at runtime, which can cause any number of additional dependencies and load cycles. Thus, before a method can be executed, hundreds of class files may be required, and loading can take an indeterminately long time.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">With real-time capabilities, industrial systems can also be controlled with Java, and software from the aerospace, medical, telecommunications, and consumer electronics sectors can be implemented with Java. This area remained closed to Java for a long time and was a domain of C(++). For this to be possible in Java, the JVM and operating system must match. While a traditional JVM runs on more or less any operating system, the requirements for real-time Java are more stringent. The foundation is always an operating system with real-time capabilities, called a 
                <span class="italic">Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)</span>, such as 
                <span class="italic">Solaris 10</span>, 
                <span class="italic">Realtime Linux</span>, 
                <span class="italic">QNX</span>,
                <span class="italic"> OS-9</span>, or 
                <span class="italic">VxWorks</span>. A real-time JVM is based on 
                <a id="p67"/>this implementation of the real-time specification. Real-time Java (RT-Java) therefore also differs, for example, in that memory areas can be allocated and released directly (
                <span class="italic">scoped memory</span>), in that more thread priorities are available, and in that scheduling is clearly more in the hands of the developers. The development is different but takes place under the familiar tools such as integrated development environments (IDEs), test tools, and libraries.

             In recent years, however, excitement has abated around real-time Java.</p>
