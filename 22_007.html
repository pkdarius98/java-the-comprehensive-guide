        JUnit Extensions and Testing Add-Ons</h2>
        
        <p class="standard">The 
            <span class="italic">JUnit</span>
         framework itself is quite compact, but as can be seen from AssertJ, you’ll need convenient testing methods that simplify typical and frequently recurring testing tasks. Not only does this include methods that test whether an element exists in a data structure, but also support for tests with database accesses, REST calls, or GUI tests.</p>
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3" id="h22.7.1">22.7.1    Web Tests</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">Two methods are used for testing web applications. One is a tool-assisted recording of web interactions and automatic playback of the consequences for testing, and the other one is the programmed solution. For recording, the free tool 
                <span class="italic">Selenium</span>

                <span class="italic">Selenium IDE </span><span class="url"><a href="http://(https://www.selenium.dev)">(https://www.selenium.dev)</a></span> is suitable. To program tests, you can find a good basis with 
                <span class="italic">REST Assured </span><span class="url"><a href="http://(https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured)">(https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured)</a></span>.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3" id="h22.7.2">22.7.2    Testing the Database Interface</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">The database is usually accessed via 
                <span class="italic">repository classes</span> (also called 
                <span class="italic">DAO classes</span>
            ). If a service accesses a database, the service always goes through the repository. Testing the service is simplified by using a repository dummy instead of a database repository implementation. The question remains, however, of how you can test the repository classes.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Testing can take a long time because interactions with a database are often the slowest steps in an entire business application. One approach is to run the tests in your local Docker container in main memory; here you can make use of the 
                <span class="italic">test containers</span> framework (<span class="url"><a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">https://www.testcontainers.org/</a></span>).</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Another task is filling the database with test data. The open-source software 
                <span class="italic">DbUnit</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i22_39"/> <span class="url"><a href="http://(http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/)">(http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/)</a></span> can help with this task. External data is written in XML and can be easily imported into the database beforehand, so that the test works on this sample data. The sample data is then inserted into the in-memory database, if possible, or into a local development database. However, for advanced testing (especially to estimate runtimes), tests must also be run with a copy of the real business data. Enterprise frameworks such as 
                <span class="italic">Spring</span>
             also provide options for easily importing test data prior to a test run.</p>
