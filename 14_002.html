        <p class="standard">A long path must be traversed from customer’s wish to the finished software. In between, you’ll encounter requirements documents, test cases, the selection of an infrastructure, database choices, licensing issues, human vanity, and much, much more. Since this book focuses on software development, let’s spend some time in the areas of architecture, design, and implementation.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">The term 
            <span class="italic">software architecture</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i14_18"/>
         isn’t really straightforward, but it means the big picture (i.e., the fundamental decisions made in creating the software). Perhaps the best way to characterize architecture is as something that is costly and time-consuming to change once put in place. A well-known architecture pattern is the layer model, which divides software into several layers. The upper layer can only access services of the layer directly below it, but can’t skip any layer, and the lower layer has no idea about higher layers.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">In design, developers take care of mapping ideas to packages, classes, and interfaces. This process isn’t unique, and so many options exist. Some options are bad because they affect readability, extensibility, or performance; others are better. But your choices always depend on context. Therefore, we’ll look at some design patterns to help guide your choices in 
            <span class="crossreference "><a href="14_003.html#h14.3">Section 14.3</a></span>
        .</p>
        
        <p class="standard">An implementation converts a design, perhaps codified in Unified Modeling Language (UML) models, into the source code of a programming language. The implementation combines a static model (i.e., which class inherits from which) and brings it together with the necessary dynamic behavior. Implementation issues might be discussed several times over, for example, when choosing the right data structure or realizing concurrency.</p>
