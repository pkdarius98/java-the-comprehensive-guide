        <p class="introductorynote indent_chapter_single">“Some people think they are polite just because they still use words at all and not fists.”<br/>—Friedrich Hebbel (1813–1863)</p>
        
        <p class="standard">In the beginning was the Word. Much later, on May 23, 1995, at SunWorld in San Francisco, the head of Sun Microsystems’s then Science Office, John Gage, and Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen introduced the new Java programming language with its integration into the Netscape web browser. This event was the beginning of the triumphal procession of a language that offers elegant ways to program on any platform and to express your thoughts in an object-oriented (OO) way. The possibilities of the language and its libraries are nothing new in themselves but have been packaged so well that Java is pleasant and fluid for programming. Java is now one of the most popular programming languages on the planet. In its 23 chapters, this book deals with the Java technology with an intense focus on the Java programming language. Important topics include object-oriented programming (OOP), designing classes, and the structure of Java’s standard libraries.</p>
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.1">Target Group</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">The chapters of this book are designed for beginners to the Java programming language as well as for advanced users. Basic knowledge of a structured programming language such as C, Python, JavaScript, or Visual Basic and knowledge of OOP are helpful because the book doesn’t explicitly address computer architectures or what programming actually is. So, if you’ve already programmed in any language, this book is for you!</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.2">What This Book Is Not</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">This book shouldn’t be taken as a programming book for beginners. If you have never programmed before and associate the word “translation” primarily with “interpreting,” you should start with a basic tutorial or follow one along in parallel. Many areas in the life of an industrial programmer are covered in this book to a general depth, but this book cannot replace the 
                <span class="italic">Java Language Specification (JLS)</span>, available at <span class="url"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs</a></span>.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">
                <a id="p32"/>
            Java technologies have exploded in recent years, so that their initial manageability has given way to strong specialization. Today, covering everything in one book isn’t possible, and we certainly won’t aim for that goal with this one. A book that deals specifically with the graphical user interface (GUI) JavaFX or Swing—both parts of standard Java—could be as extensive as the book you’re holding in your hands. Other special topics include OO analysis/design, Unified Modeling Language (UML), parallel or distributed programming, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), database connectivity, object-relational mapping, web services, dynamic web pages, and many other topics. For all those topics, special-purpose books may be required to satisfy your curiosity.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">This Java book trains you on the syntax of the programming language, the handling of important standard libraries, development tools and development environments, OO analysis and design, design patterns, and program conventions. But this book can’t help you impress the cool IT geeks at a party. Sorry.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.3">My Life and Java, Or “Why a Java Book?”</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">My involvement with Java started over 20 years ago and is related to a compulsory university course. In 1997, our project group dealt with an OO dialog specification. A state machine had to be programmed, and the question of which programming language to use came up. Since I wanted to introduce Java to the seminar’s participants, I prepared a set of slides for our presentation. Parallel to the slides, the professor expected an elaboration in the form of a seminar paper. Working with Java was fun and something completely different from what I had been used to until then. Before Java, I had coded in Assembler for about 10 years; then later, I used the high-level languages Pascal and C, and mainly built compilers. I tried and tested code, wrote down my experiences, and learned about Java and its libraries. The work grew with my experience. During time in this group project, a fellow student approached me to give a Java training as a speaker. I felt like doing it but didn’t have any documents. So, I kept writing training materials for the course. When the professor asked for the seminar paper at the end of the group project, the preliminary manuscript of the current book was already so extensive that this introduction more or less became the seminar paper.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">That was in 1997, and of course, I could have stopped writing immediately after I turned in the paper. But to this day, I still enjoy Java and look forward to each new version. And I am not alone in my optimism: The forecasts for Java remain promising because the use of Java is now as established as that of COBOL
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i00_00"/>
             in banking and insurance. That’s why people keep talking about Java being “the new COBOL.”</p>
            
            <p class="standard">After about two decades, I now consider this book to be a multifaceted Java resource for ambitious developers who want to look behind the scenes. Its level of detail is not reached by any other book about the basics of Java in English—at least that I know of! I have enjoyed extending the book, even if many topics are hardly addressed in a normal Java course.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.4">
                <a id="p33"/>
            Software and Versions</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">The basis for this book is 
                <span class="italic">Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE)</span> version 17 using the free OpenJDK implementation, which is a kind of 
                <span class="italic">Java Development Kit (JDK)</span>. The JDK essentially consists of a compiler and a runtime environment—the 
                <span class="italic">Java virtual machine (JVM)</span>
            —and is available for the Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris platforms.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">A graphical development interface, called an 
                <span class="italic">integrated development environment (IDE)</span>, is not part of the JDK. While I don’t advocate relying on one vendor (because vendors appeal to different groups of developers), this book introduces 
                <span class="italic">IntelliJ</span>
             development environments in slightly greater detail. Our sample programs can basically be entered into any other development environment or text editor—such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or vi—and compiled on the command line. However, pure text editors are outdated in development, and a graphical command-line approach simplifies program creation.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.5">Which Java Version to Use</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">Since Oracle (then still led by Sun) introduced the Java programming language in 1995 with version 1.0, the version spiral has inexorably turned. A new version is released every 6 months, and every 2 years, a Long-Term-Support-Release (LTS), with updates for a longer period of time, is released. The latest LTS is Java 17. Especially for authors writing books about Java, the question arises as to which Java version the text should be based on and which libraries should be described. In this book, we always describe the capabilities of the latest version, which was Java 18 at the time of this writing. For the didactics of OOP, the version question is fortunately irrelevant.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">The examples in this book are consistently based on Java 17. </p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.6">Using This Book to Learn</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">This book is ideal for self-study. The first chapter is for warming up. If you don’t have a development environment installed on your computer, you should first install the JDK from Oracle. Because the JDK only installs command-line tools, every developer should install a graphical IDE because an IDE makes the development of Java programs much more comfortable. An IDE provides several advantages over the raw command line, such as the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Editing, compiling, and running a Java program are quick and easy with a keystroke or mouse click.</p>

                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">An editor should highlight the syntax of Java in color (

                    A context-sensitive help shows the parameters for methods and at the same time provides access to the application programming interface (API) documentation.</p>
                
                </li>

                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Other benefits such as a GUI builder, project management, and debugging are added but don’t play any role in this book.</p>
                
                </li>
            
            </ul>
            
            <p class="standard">In software development, the documentation of API interfaces is essential. Documentation can usually be viewed from the development environment with the touch of a button or found online.

             also provides URLs for the available documentation.</p>

                <span class="crossreference "><a href="07_001.html#h7">Chapter 7</a></span> form the OO center of the book: These chapters teach the OO concepts of

            , you’ll have been introduced to all the basics of Java.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.7">Personal Learning Strategies</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">If using this book in self-study, a successful learning strategy can be described. The key to understanding, as is so often the case, is the psychology of learning, which examines the reading conditions under which a text can be optimally understood. The method I’d like to present is called the 
                <span class="italic">PQ4R method</span>
            , which stands for the following steps:</p>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>

                        <span class="italic">Preview</span>
                    : First, you should get an initial overview of the chapter, for example, by browsing the table of contents and skipping the pages of individual chapters. Look at the figures and tables a little longer, as they already give away the content and make you want to read the text.</p>

                    : Here we go—you must read the text. Unless you’ve borrowed a library book, you should highlight passages you think are important with lots of color and add notes in the margins. The same applies to new terms. Everyone should be able to answer the previously asked questions. If new questions arise, store them in your memory!</p>

                        <span class="italic">elaborative processing</span>). In this process, topics must be linked to other topics. Think about how the statements fit with the other parts. Now is also a good time for practical exercises. For the examples given in this book, you should think of your own examples. If we describe an 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">if</samp> statement using age as an example, an idea of your own could be something like an

The PQ4R method should therefore be given an additional “R” for long-term success: “R” for “repeat” or “refresh.” As a rule, people over-read something at the beginning and pay little attention to details. Later, when more background knowledge is available, even basic things can appear in a new light and fit into the overall picture. Readers should therefore pick up the book again and again and turn its pages.</p>

Newcomers may need to stray from the sequential path of chapters at some points since some chapters may require more background information and familiarity with programming languages. Comparisons with other programming languages are intended for loosening up and comparison and aren’t necessary for the understanding of Java.</p>

             highlights the special features of the Java language. In this chapter, I draw some comparisons with other popular OO languages. This chapter is not particularly technical and also describes the historical course of Java’s evolution. The chapter isn’t didactically structured, so that some concepts aren’t covered in depth until the later chapters; beginners should skim through it. We’ll also show you how to obtain and install a JDK so that your first programs can be compiled and run. Learning will be more fun with a development environment, so an introduction to IDEs is provided as well.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Things really get going in 
                <span class="bold">

            . This chapter describes variables, types, and imperative language elements by describing statements and expressions that form the foundation of any program. Descriptions of case statements, loop types, and methods can also be found in this chapter. These features are still possible without much object orientation.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Things do actually become OO in 
                <span class="bold">
                    <span class="crossreference "><a href="03_001.html#h3">Chapter 3</a></span>
                </span>. We’ll first explore the classes available in the standard library and develop our own classes later because our focus is on the basic concepts first, such as the keyword 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">new</samp>, references, the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">null</samp>
             reference, and reference comparisons. The standard library is so rich that, with predefined classes and this basic knowledge alone, many programs can be developed. The provided data structures can be used in many ways.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Several data types can be combined in an array, which is introduced in 
                <span class="bold">
                    <span class="crossreference "><a href="04_001.html#h4">Chapter 4</a></span>
                </span>. Arrays also form the basis of some Java concepts such as variable argument lists and the extended 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">for</samp>
            .</p>
            
            <p class="standard">The reason behind many problems is the changed “handling of characters and strings,” which we’ll introduce in 
                <span class="bold">
                    <span class="crossreference "><a href="05_001.html#h5">Chapter 5</a></span>
                </span>. In this chapter, the important types 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Character</samp> (the data type for single characters), 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">String</samp>,
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter"> </samp>and 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">StringBuilder</samp> (data types for strings) will be introduced. Concerning strings, sometimes, parts must be cut out, recognized, and converted. A 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">split(...)</samp> from the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">String</samp> class is possible, and the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Scanner</samp> class can split strings into substrings using separators. 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Format</samp>
             objects put any output into the desired format, including the output of decimal numbers.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">
                <a id="p37"/>With this knowledge about object creation and references, the next step can take place: 
                <span class="bold">
                    <span class="crossreference "><a href="06_001.html#h6">Chapter 6</a></span>
                </span>
             deals with writing custom classes. Using games and rooms, we’ll model object properties. Important concepts such as constructors, static properties, and enumerations are described in this chapter.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Object relationships, that is, the associations between objects (also referred to as “uses-A relationships”) and inheritance relationships are the subjects of 
                <span class="bold">

                </span>
            . This chapter introduces “real” OOP and covers dynamic binding, abstract classes, and visibility.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Java supports several types, and besides classes, another important type is the interface. 
                <span class="bold">

                </span>
             introduces this particular type as well as two other types: enumeration types and records.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Exceptions, which are discussed in 
                <span class="bold">

            , form an important backbone for all programs since errors can hardly be avoided. For this reason, the active support of their handling is advised since doing so forces a programmer to take care of errors and fix them.</p>

             describes how classes can be nested within each other. This nesting can improve encapsulation because implementations can then also be local.</p>

                </span> describes classes that are central to the Java library, such as comparison classes, wrapper classes, and the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Object</samp>
             class, which is the superclass of all Java classes.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Generics can be used to declare classes, interfaces, and methods with a kind of type placeholder, where the concrete type is defined later.

             provides insight into this technology.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Lambda expressions have been around since Java 8; they simplify functional programming in particular. We devote 
                <span class="bold">
                    <span class="crossreference "><a href="13_001.html#h13">Chapter 13</a></span>

             to language properties. In this chapter, you’ll also learn about many standard types that are used in functional programming.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">At this point, the foundations have been laid, and the remaining chapters build on the knowledge already acquired.

                </span> introduces SOLID principles, shows applications of good OOP, and introduces 
                <span class="italic">design patterns</span>
            . Based on various examples, this chapter demonstrates how interfaces and class hierarchies can be used effectively in Java. The key is to think small but to write big applications.</p>

             describes how, in Java, individual components or systems of components can be used flexibly for other applications.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">After the first 15 chapters, readers will be almost completely familiar with the Java language. However, since Java is not only a language but also a set of standard libraries, the second half of the book focuses on basic APIs. At the end of each chapter, a “Further Reading” section provides references to interesting online resources. At this point, readers can leave the sequential path and focus on individual topics since the remaining topics are usually not directly interdependent.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">The Java library consists of over 4,000 classes, interfaces, enumerations, exceptions, and annotations. 
                <span class="crossreference "><a href="16_001.html#h16">Chapter 16</a></span> provides an overview of the most important packages and 
                <a id="p38"/>
            picks out some classes from the library, such as loading classes. In this chapter, you’ll also find classes for configuring applications or ways to run external programs.</p>

                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Method names and constructors are always followed by a pair of parentheses to distinguish methods/constructors from object/class variables. Thus, when writing 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">System.out</samp> and 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">System.gc()</samp>
                    , you can clearly see that the former is a class variable, and the latter is a method.</p>

                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">If a method or constructor has a parameter, the type is enclosed in parentheses, for example, 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Math.abs(double a)</samp> or 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Point(int x, int y)</samp>. Often the parameter name is also omitted, for example, “
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">System.exit(int)</samp> exits the program with a return value.” The Java API documentation does the same. If a method or constructor has a parameter list, but is not relevant in the text, it’s abbreviated with ellipses, as in “
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">...</samp>”. For example: “The 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">System.out.print(...)</samp> method converts the passed arguments to strings 
                        <a id="p39"/>and prints them.” Thus, an empty pair of parentheses means that a method or constructor really has no parameter list. To make the specification short and yet precise, you’ll see some specifications in the text like 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">getProperty(String key[, String def])</samp>, which is an abbreviation for 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">getProperty(String key)</samp> and 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">getProperty(String key, String def)</samp>
                    . Elsewhere, the ellipses (...) are also found when the implementation or screen outputs aren’t further required for understanding.</p>
                
                </li>
                
                <li>

                        </span> identifier symbolizes a placeholder. For example, 
                        <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">print*(...)</samp> stands for the methods

            <h3 class="t3 intro" id="h0.1.16">Acknowledgments</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">I was 9 years old when my parents opened the world of computers to me with the Commodore 64. Because I lacked a medium to save programs and data, I had no choice but to re-enter everything after rebooting—the way I learned how to program. To my parents, a big thanks for the computer, for the love, and for trusting me.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Thanks are due to Sun Microsystems, which began development on Java in 1991. Without Sun, there would be no Java, and without Java, there wouldn’t be this book. Thanks also to Oracle, as the buyer of Sun, because perhaps without the acquisition Java would have been finished.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Java lives—maybe I should say, “survives”—through many free tools and an active open-source community. A big “thank you” goes to all developers who write and maintain the many great Java tools, libraries, and frameworks available today, such as Eclipse, Maven, JUnit, and Spring Tomcat. Without them, Java wouldn’t be where it is today.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Finally, I would like to express my thanks to Rheinwerk Publishing for helping me publish this book. I’m grateful for the collaboration with my editor.</p>
