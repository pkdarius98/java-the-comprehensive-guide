            Three Rules</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">The first three rules are:</p>

                    Code duplication should be avoided, and duplicate code should be outsourced to methods. Furthermore, existing code—from your own libraries, from Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) or open-source libraries—should be used.</p>

                        <span class="bold">Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)</span><br/>More precisely, “keep it simple and foolproof.” A problem should be solved in a simple and easy-to-understand way. For developers, this rule means you should write simple code, maybe only few lines of code, understandable at first sight.</p>

                     and the idea of “always implementing the simplest possible solution that works.” Something may be programmed that never goes live later, which is a waste of time and money, but the code still needs to be documented, maintained, and tested.</p>

                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i14_07"/>
                </h4>
                
                <p class="standard">In somewhat flippant terms, this principle stands for “Do exactly one thing, but do it right.” A type should have exactly one 
                    <span class="italic">responsibility</span>, so that, when changes are made, in the best case, only one place must be adjusted and not many places. The opposite is referred to as 
                    <span class="italic">God classes</span>, that is, classes that can do anything—an anti-pattern. Robert C. Martin, who describes the single responsibility principle in his book 
                    <span class="italic">Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices</span>
                , also says, “There should never be more than one reason to change a class.” So what does this principle mean in practical terms?</p>
                
                <p class="standard">Let’s assume a person class stores a name, zip code, and age. Some requirements exist for zip codes and ages: In the US, a postal code consists only of digits and is 5 digits long. In general, an age is never a negative number and is limited and finite. However, these two validations are two different things, so a person class takes on responsibilities that in themselves have nothing to do with a person. Accordingly, the class will need to be adjusted in two places when the validation is changed; two reasons are more than one reason and consequently break the single responsibility principle.</p>
                
                <p class="standard">
                    <a id="p801"/>
                If the modeling takes the single responsibility principle to an extreme, too many small types are created. This profusion of types doesn’t help other code developers if responsibilities are no longer understandable due to this confusion.</p>

                <p class="standard">Bertrand Meyer formulated in his 1988 book 
                    <span class="italic">Object-Oriented Software Construction</span> that modules must be both 
                    <span class="italic">open</span> (for extensions) and 
                    <span class="italic">closed</span>
                 (for modifications). Where others use the term “module,” Java developers should imagine a “type.” A conventional class is closed to modification, especially with private states, but a subclass allows new states to be added without code changes to the superclass. Additionally, methods can be overridden to customize an implementation. However, a subclass must not give methods different semantics, which would otherwise break the object’s cohesiveness.</p>

                <p class="standard">Barbara Liskov gave the 1987 lecture “Data Abstraction and Hierarchy” about the fact that replacing objects in programs with objects of a subtype should be possible without sacrificing correctness. Of course, for the replacement to work, the subtype must know what is “correct” so that methods do not realize an incorrect implementation that breaks the behavior. In other words, children must inherit and respect the behavior of their parents. This rule is not easy in Java because syntactic constructs such as preconditions, postconditions, and invariants don’t exist; developers must therefore extract what is correct behavior purely from the Javadoc (i.e., the textual information).</p>

                    <span class="italic">interface</span>
                 means the range of methods in general. In practical terms, some types have a lot of methods that thus make these types “general.” If such objects are passed around, then the program places always get the entire object with all methods. However, the complete range of methods isn’t always necessary, and sharing all the methods may even be dangerous. A better approach is to keep the application programming interface (API) small, allowing various entities only what is actually needed.</p>
