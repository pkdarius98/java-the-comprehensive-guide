        A Programming Task</h2>
        
        <p class="standard">Good OO modeling isn’t easy and requires a lot of practice. Many developers start “modeling” in the code way too early, but doing so isn’t a good idea because you’ll often need rebuild the code, which ultimately costs time. Starting with a neat design makes sense, and you should be clear: “Which class has which responsibilities, and who talks to whom?” To document the design, UML diagrams are helpful, and for this purpose, we recommend reviewing documentation on the internet or picking up a book like 
            <span class="italic">UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language</span>
         by Martin Fowler. Starting the design with boxes and lines on paper or on a whiteboard can also be extremely useful.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">In the previous two chapters, we laid the foundation for our Jawbreaker game, which you are welcome to finish. Let’s briefly summary some of its basic rules:</p>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>
                
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">At the beginning, the player has $2,000 in cash and $0 in debt.</p>
            
            </li>
            
            <li>
                
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">In the original game, drugs like cocaine, heroin, etc. were used. Put in your favorite candy instead. The player can buy and sell these in his city.</p>
            
            </li>
            
            <li>
                
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">The prices of drugs ($) in the original game ranged in values, for instance, cocaine costs 15,000–30,000, heroin costs 5,000–14,000, and so on. Prices should fluctuate randomly, and drug prices may decrease/increase as the player travels. Set your own price ranges for the candies.</p>
            
            </li>
            
            <li>
                
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">A player can carry a maximum of 100 products. (All products have the same weight.)</p>
