        <p class="standard">Programming functionally changes the design of Java programs fundamentally—away from methods with side effects to small functions that return objects with new states. The future will reveal novel patterns and best practices on how to develop in Java. Also, whether further concepts of functional programming will flow into Java and/or the JVM remain to be seen. So far, for example, immutability isn’t a language construct but is guaranteed by the API if setters and write access to variables are absent. However, reflection can throw a wrench in the works as well. Approaches for upcoming Java versions in the area of 
            <span class="italic">pattern matching</span> are presented by Brian Goetz at <span class="url"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3_8YcYKScw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3_8YcYKScw</a></span>. At <span class="url"><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406">https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406</a></span>, you’ll find a project description, and in Java 17, pattern matching can even already be used with the 
            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">––enable–preview</samp> switch. 
            <span class="italic">Tail call optimization (TCO)</span>
         on the JVM side—something held dear in other functional programming languages—isn’t currently implemented in the HotSpot JVM.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">Java provides functional interfaces for the usual scenarios in the 
            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">java.util.function</samp> package. But these interfaces may not be enough. For example, no available functional interface has three, four, five … parameters. Some gaps are filled, for example, by <span class="url"><a href="https://www.vavr.io">https://www.vavr.io</a></span>, which provides a new implementation of 
            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Optional</samp> in addition to immutable data structures and also provides a 
            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Try</samp>
         monad.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">To delve even deeper into the functional programming mindset, we recommend developers look into pure functional programming languages like Haskell, where you must work without side effects. Somewhat easier for Java programmers is the ML language family, which also provides imperative elements such as 
            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">while</samp>
         loops. For Java programmers, this mixing usually seems weird—the hip programming languages Scala or Kotlin combine OOP and functional programming almost perfectly. Java developers may benefit most from the functional approaches in the Stream API, which has already been briefly touched upon.</p>
