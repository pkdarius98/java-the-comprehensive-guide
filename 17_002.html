        <p class="standard">In this section, we’ll illustrate how the concurrent program code is packaged into a 
            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Runnable</samp>
         and presented to the thread for execution.</p>

            Main Thread</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">Every program code in Java always runs in a thread. When the JVM starts, it automatically creates a thread called the 
                <span class="italic">main thread</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i17_13"/>. This thread processes the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">main(...)</samp> method. Everything you put in the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">main(...)</samp>
             method is processed by the main thread, which can be easily seen in a debugger. </p>
            
            <p class="standard">Usually, other threads exist in the Java environment, which are started by the system via the help of libraries. When Java opens a window, for instance, a GUI thread is started in which related events are processed.</p>

            <p class="standard">In Java, a thread is represented by the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">java.lang.Thread</samp>
             class, which connects the Java side with the operating system side. </p>

                <a class="indexanchor" id="i17_14"/> to provide the object reference for the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp> instance that’s currently executing the code. In this way, non-static

            Starting Thread with Runnable</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">Now, simply calling the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp> method of a class directly is not enough because then nothing would be concurrent; we would simply execute a method sequentially. For the program code to run alongside the actual application, you must connect a 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i17_17"/> object to the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Runnable</samp> and then explicitly start the thread. For this step, you’ll pass a reference to the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Runnable</samp> object to the constructor of the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp> class and call 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i17_18"/>. Once 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp> has created a runtime environment for the thread, it internally calls the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp> method exactly once by itself. If the thread is already running, a second call of the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp> method throws an 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">IllegalThreadStateException</samp>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i17_19"/>
            . Consider the following example:</p>
            
            <div class="listing " id="l17.3"><pre>Thread t1 <span class="">=</span><span class=""> </span>

            <p class="standard">When the program is started, something like the following example output may appear on your screen:</p>
            
            <div class="listing " id="l_none_1786"><pre>0<br/>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>4<br/>5<br/>6<br/>7<br/>8<br/>2017-02-17T13:40:35.315250400<br/>2017-02-17T13:40:35.327260600<br/>2017-02-17T13:40:35.327260600<br/>2017-02-17T13:40:35.327260600<br/>9<br/>10<br/>11<br/>12<br/>13<br/>14<br/>15<br/>16<br/>17<br/>18<br/>

            <p class="standard">In this output, you can see the interlocking of the two threads. Although the sequence is clearly defined within a thread by the loop, the operating system will determine when it’s the turn of any specific thread. So, we’re not surprised that the first line in this output comes from the counting thread, which is actually the second thread. This scenario clearly demonstrates the non-determinism
                <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn17_02" id="fn17_02">[ 217 ]</a></span>
             in threads. The output can be interpreted by the different runtimes required for the date and time output: Date processing requires many more objects and creating them takes time. But these needs are an internal matter, which must not play any role in the sequence. If you expect thread results in a specific order, you’ll need to synchronize threads.</p>

                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp>, calling the inherited 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp> method will suffice. Now, the program continues working directly, so it executes the next statement after 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp> a short time later. However, you should refrain using from this variant because the “executor” (i.e., the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp>) should be separated from the code to be executed (the

                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">super.start()</samp> so that the thread actually starts. For us as thread users to avoid having to call the 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp> method first, a thread can also start itself. The constructor simply calls its own

                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp>, like 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp>, is a public method of the 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp> class—
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp> implements 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Runnable</samp>, so the 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp> method must be 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">public</samp>. One programming mistake that beginners often make is when, instead of 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp>, they accidentally call 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp> on the 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp>. What happens then? Almost exactly the same as with 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">start()</samp>, the only difference being that the object method 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp> isn’t processed concurrently with the rest of the program. The current thread processes the 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp> method sequentially until it finishes and the statements after the call take their turn. The error isn’t always directly noticeable because the actions in 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">run()</samp>
                 do take place, just not concurrently.</p>

                <p class="standard">The best approach is to create 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Runnable</samp> objects that are then passed to the thread. Command objects of this type are quite flexible because simple 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Runnable</samp> objects can be easily passed and even executed by threads from a thread pool. One disadvantage of extending 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp> is that single inheritance can be troublesome; if a class inherits from 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp>, the extension is already “used up.” But whether a class implements 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Runnable</samp> or extends 
                    <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">Thread</samp>
                , one thing remains: a new class.</p>
