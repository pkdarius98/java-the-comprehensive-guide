        <p class="standard">For the representation of a class, program code can be used (i.e., either text or a graphical notation). One of the available graphical description types is the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_14"/>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_15"/>
        . Graphic illustrations are much easier for people to understand and provide a broader overview.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">In the first section of a UML diagram, you can read the attributes of an object; in the second section, its operations. The

        , indicates that they are public, and anyone can use them. Compared to Java, the type specification is reversed: First comes the name of the variable, then the type or (in the case of methods) the type of the return value. Other programming languages such as TypeScript or Kotlin also use this “flipped” type specification in the code.</p>

        The java.awt.Point Class in a UML Representation</p>
        
        <p class="standard">UML defines various diagram types that can describe different views of the software. Different diagrams are important for the individual phases in software design. Let’s take a brief look at four diagrams and their areas of use.</p>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>
                
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">
                    <span class="bold">Use cases diagram</span> <br/>A 
                    <span class="italic">use cases diagram</span>
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_16"/> is usually created during the requirements phase and describes business processes by showing how people—or existing programs—interact with the system. The acting persons or active systems are called 
                    <span class="italic">actors</span>
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_17"/> and are indicated in the diagram as small people. Use cases
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_18"/>
                 then describe the interaction with the system.</p>
            
            </li>
            
            <li>

                    <span class="bold">Class diagram</span> <br/>For a static view of a program’s design, the 
                    <span class="italic">class diagram</span>
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_19"/>
                 is one of the most important diagram types. On one hand, a class diagram represents the elements of the class (i.e., its attributes and operations), and on the other hand, the relationships among the classes. Class diagrams are used most frequently in this book, especially to show association and inheritance to other classes. Classes are represented as rectangles in such a diagram, and the relationships between classes are indicated by lines.</p>
            
            </li>
            
            <li>
                
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">
                    <span class="bold">Object diagram </span><br/>At first glance, a class diagram and an object diagram are quite similar. The main difference is that an 
                    <span class="italic">object diagram</span>
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_20"/> visualizes the assignment of attributes (i.e., the object states). For this purpose, 
                    <span class="italic">instance specifications</span>
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_21"/>
                 are used, which include the relationships the object has with other objects at runtime. For example, if a class diagram describes a person, one rectangle appears in the diagram. If this person has friends at runtime (i.e., has associations to other person objects), then a great many people can be associated in an object diagram, while a class diagram can’t represent this instance.</p>
            
            </li>
            
            <li>
                
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">
                    <span class="bold">
                        <a id="p206"/>
                    Sequence diagram </span><br/>The 
                    <span class="italic">sequence diagram</span>
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_22"/> represents the dynamic behavior of objects.
                    <a class="indexanchor" id="i03_23"/>
                 Thus, this diagram shows the order in which operations are called and when new objects are created. The individual objects are given a vertical lifeline, and horizontal lines between the lifelines of the objects describe the operations or object creations. Thus, the diagram is read from top to bottom.</p>
            
            </li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <p class="standard">Since the class diagram and object diagram tend to describe the structure of software, these models are also called 
            <span class="italic">structure diagrams</span> (along with package diagrams, component diagrams, composition structure diagrams, and distribution diagrams). A use case diagram and a sequence diagram tend to show dynamic behavior and are therefore referred to as 
            <span class="italic">behavior diagrams</span>
        . Other behavior diagrams include state diagrams, activity diagrams, interaction overview diagrams, communication diagrams, and timing diagrams. In UML, however, capturing the central statements of the system in a diagram is the goal, and thus, diagram types can be mixed without any problem.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">In this book, you’ll find mostly class diagrams.</p>
