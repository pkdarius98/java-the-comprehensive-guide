        <h2 class="t2" id="h1.4">1.4    Further Development and Losses</h2>
        
        <p class="standard">In the ongoing evolution of Java, there were always phases in which development was rather slow, and then phases where many new features were added. From time to time, features were also removed, which is rather surprising, because backward compatibility plays a very big role at Oracle, and played a similar role earlier at Sun.</p>
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.4.1">1.4.1    The Development of Java and Its Future Prospects</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">Twenty years ago, Java had two major advantages: simplicity compared to its predecessor C++ and the absence of “dangerous” syntactic constructs. As one of the language fathers, James Gosling (who left Sun after Oracle acquired it) wrote back in 1997:</p>
            
            <blockquote><p>“Java is a blue collar language. It’s not PhD thesis material but a language for a job. Java feels very familiar to many different programmers because I had a very strong tendency to prefer things that had been used a lot over things that just sounded like a good idea.”
                <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn01_20" id="fn01_20">[ 20 ]</a></span>
            </p></blockquote>
            
            <p class="standard">The desire for a simple language still exists today; however, a lot has happened in the past 20 years, and Java has become significantly more complex. Significant language changes occurred in Java 5 (about 10 years after the introduction of Java) and in Java 8. The module system in Java 9 also presented new challenges.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">In the trinity of the Java platform—with 1) Java as programming language, 2) the standard libraries, and 3) the JVM as runtime environment—great dynamism exists among the different programming languages running on the JVM. More and more apparent is the fact that developers who program in Java will continue to develop in Java but will also use a second programming language on the JVM. Thus, in addition to the Java programming language, various alternatives exist, such as 
                <span class="italic">Kotlin</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_84"/> <span class="url"><a href="http://(https://kotlinlang.org">(https://kotlinlang.org</a></span>), 
                <span class="italic">
                    <a id="p60"/>
                Clojure</span> (<span class="url"><a href="https://www.clojure.org">https://www.clojure.org</a></span>), 
                <span class="italic">Scala</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_85"/> (<span class="url"><a href="https://www.scala-lang.org">https://www.scala-lang.org</a></span>), 
                <span class="italic">Groovy</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_86"/> (<span class="url"><a href="https://groovy-lang.org">https://groovy-lang.org</a></span>), 
                <span class="italic">JRuby</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_87"/> (<span class="url"><a href="https://www.jruby.org">https://www.jruby.org</a></span>), or 
                <span class="italic">Jython</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_88"/> <span class="url"><a href="http://(https://www.jython.org">(https://www.jython.org</a></span>), which all run on the JVM—different languages, same runtime environment. Scripting languages on the Java platform are quite popular; they establish a different syntax but use the JVM and libraries. Because these alternative programming languages are based on the JVM, they can use all Java libraries and therefore replace Java as a programming language in some areas. The fact that the alternative languages draw on the usual standard libraries works smoothly; however, the reverse, for example, using Scala libraries from within Jython, hasn’t (yet) been standardized. This flexibility works better with the .NET platform, where it really doesn’t matter whether you declare or use C# or VB.NET classes.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">When the Sun acquisition was around the corner, Oracle was committed to Sun technologies. After the 2010 acquisition, the picture changed somewhat, and Oracle made more negative headlines, such as when it stopped supporting OpenSolaris, scaled back MySQL and considered it a threat to its own database, and was late in handing OpenOffice over to Apache. (LibreOffice had already taken on a life of its own.) Oracle also behaves quite differently than Sun when it comes to information policy and the support of user groups. By suing Google for copyright infringement in Android, Oracle didn’t make any friends either. Android is considered proof that Java is indeed successful on the client side. When security gaps were discovered in Java, the company’s reputation was again damaged. Overall, an assessment is likely to say, “Oracle has made an effort to meet the requirements.”</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Almost 10 years after the acquisition, new radical changes have occurred. For the first time, Oracle removed parts of the Java SE library, such as CORBA support, JAXB, JAX-RS (web services), applets, Java Web Start, and JavaFX. Furthermore, the JavaScript engine has now disappeared. Thus, the previously sacred mantra of backwards compatibility has been done away with—a current JVM can’t run older Java software in every case.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.4.2">1.4.2    Features, Enhancements, and Specification Requests</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">Java grows from version to version, so regular major increases in libraries occur as well as well-proportioned changes to the language and minimal changes to the JVM. Changes to the Java SE platform are categorized into features and enhancements. An 
                <span class="italic">enhancement</span> is a small change that isn’t worth mentioning—for example, a small function like 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">isEmpty()</samp> has been added to the 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">String</samp>
             class. These enhancements don’t require much coordination and planning and are easily integrated by Oracle staff.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">
                <span class="italic">Features</span>, on the other hand, are somewhat bigger in terms of implementation effort. In this case, the community might have been desperate for this functionality—they make this need clear by placing a feature request on Oracle’s website, and then many people voted for this feature. Another peculiarity is how many features are planned because often a 
                <span class="italic">Java Specification Request (JSR)</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_89"/>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_90"/> is created, which prescribes a certain planning 
                <a id="p61"/>order. Most changes to libraries are described by a JSR, and now hundreds of JSRs exist, as you can see at <span class="url"><a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/overview">https://jcp.org/en/jsr/overview</a></span>.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">In the early days, the implementation was also the specification, but now, descriptive specifications for the Java compiler, the JVM, and various libraries are available, which is also true for Java as a whole. 
                <span class="italic">Java SE</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_91"/>
             is a specification that implements, for example, the Oracle JDK and OpenJDK. The Oracle JDK is based on the OpenJDK, and the OpenJDK is licensed under the GPL license. OpenJDK is the reference implementation and thus defines the standard, which is important if certain properties aren’t documented.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.4.3">1.4.3    Applets</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">An understatement would be to attribute the widespread use of Java to the web. Java became popular in the mid-1990s through 
                <span class="italic">applets</span>
            —Java programs executed by a browser. An HTML file referenced the applet, which was assigned a place on the web page, and the browser independently retrieved the class files and resources over the network and executed them in the JVM.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">Over time, the importance of Java applets declined, due to a language that also appeared in 1995: JavaScript. Java applets first brought dynamism and moving graphics to what had been static web pages, but when the CSS (1996) and SVG (2001) web standards emerged, an increasing number of web developers turned to combining JavaScript with these standards. Java applets, justz like Flash or Silverlight, all have a problem: They require a browser plugin, which makes them unattractive for companies, since no customer should be excluded on the internet. In the past, when web standards weren’t as advanced, Flash and Silverlight enabled building interactive web pages, but today, elaborate web applications are achievable with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">A long time has passed since the early Netscape and Internet Explorer browsers integrated a JVM; at some point, these vendors removed it. For a while, Oracle shipped the 
                <span class="italic">Java Plug-in</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_92"/>
             (spelled this way) to integrate its own JVM into browsers. However, modern browsers no longer support the Java Plug-in. Due to this lack of support from browsers—and the lack of good web standards—Oracle marked applets as deprecated in Java 9 and removed them completely in Java 10.</p>
        
        
        
        
            
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.4.4">1.4.4    JavaFX</h3>
            
            <p class="standard">
                <span class="italic">Rich Internet Applications (RIA)</span> are graphically rich web applications that typically pull data from the internet. For many years, 
                <span class="italic">Adobe Flash</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_93"/> dominated the field, almost 100%, and Microsoft played along for a time with Silverlight
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_94"/>. Oracle, too, didn’t want to leave the field to its competitors for strategic reasons. When it became apparent that applets were unpopular and too inflexible for complex GUI applications, Oracle released the 
                <span class="italic">JavaFX platform</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_95"/> at the end of 2008 after a lengthy internal project phase. JavaFX is a 
                <a id="p62"/>
            completely new GUI stack and completely decoupled from Swing and the Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT).</p>
            
            <p class="standard">In the first JavaFX version, the 
                <span class="italic">JavaFX Script</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_96"/>
             programming language was part of JavaFX, but from version JavaFX 2 onwards, Oracle has changed directions: JavaFX is now a pure Java library, and the idiosyncratic JavaFX Script programming language is a thing of the past. However, with scripting languages on the JVM, a comparable “feel” is guaranteed.</p>
            
            <p class="standard">For a while, it looked like JavaFX could inherit the GUI stack 
                <span class="italic">AWT/Swing</span>. Swing is a GUI library that has been part of the standard since Java 1.2 (1998) but hasn’t received any significant features for 10 years, although bugs are fixed regularly. But after the initial hype around JavaFX, Oracle pulled many developers away and put JavaFX on the sidelines. For Oracle, desktop technologies no longer play a role, which is why Oracle said goodbye to JavaFX altogether in 2018: As of Java 11, JavaFX is no longer integrated. Oracle has transferred JavaFX to the 
                <span class="italic">OpenJFX</span> project
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_97"/> (<span class="url"><a href="https://openjfx.io/">https://openjfx.io/</a></span>), where it is being further developed as an open-source project—a mirror is located at <span class="url"><a href="https://github.com/teamfx">https://github.com/teamfx</a></span>. For JavaFX fans, going open source was more of an advantage than a disadvantage because decoupling allows for more flexible further development. OpenJFX will then be a module like any other.</p>
