        <p class="standard">The Java SE platform is basically just a specification and not an implementation. For programs to be compiled and executed, you’ll need a real compiler, a runtime environment, and an implementation of the libraries. Different implementations from different manufacturers are available. If an implementation passes a series of tests called

            <p class="standard">You might be confused why Oracle provides the reference implementation on one side and yet another distribution on the other (the 
                <span class="italic">Oracle JDK</span>
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_120"/>). The Oracle JDK is the “official” version provided by Oracle’s Java download site. A few small differences include the packaging (Oracle JDK has an installer while Oracle OpenJDK is just a ZIP file), the version identifier, and a few more modules.
                <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn01_25" id="fn01_25">[ 25 ]</a></span>
             The Oracle JDK is available under the Oracle No-Fee license and can be used privately as well as commercially. Oracle promises updates to the version at least until September 2024.</p>

                Long-Term Support</h4>
                
                <p class="standard">The semi-annual Java releases mean that versions are always out of date when a new version is released. For companies, problems may arise from having to keep up with the changes, which can create stress. For this reason, Oracle provides a Java version with Long-Term Support (LTS) and provides updates and security patches for this version. The LTS versions after Java 8 were Java 11 (September 2018) and currently Java 17 (September 2021). This version is useful for less agile companies. Oracle plans to maintain its Java SE 8 implementation for many years to come. The plan is to shorten the LTS cycle from 3 years to 2 years.</p>
            
            
            
            
                
                <h4 class="t4" id="h1.6.2.2">Oracle Java SE Subscription</h4>
                
                <p class="standard">Companies often want to hedge their bets; thus, Oracle also offers a 
                    <span class="italic">Java SE subscription</span>
                . With this offering, Oracle provides commercial support in case problems or errors arise in productive operation. Costs can add up quickly, but companies can be supported, which is especially useful for the older Java 8 version, which may be supported for several years to come. One disadvantage is that the subscription model is only available for the LTS versions, so companies are forced to make larger version jumps if they want the support. Other companies like Azul are cheaper and also provide support for non-LTS versions.</p>
            
            
            
            
                
                <h4 class="t4" id="h1.6.2.3">Oracle Certified System Configurations</h4>
                
                <p class="standard">An ideal, perfectly tested, and supported environment is considered an 
                    <span class="italic">Oracle Certified System Configuration</span>. This combination of operating system with installed service packs is described in detail on the company website, including for all previous versions.
                    <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn01_26" id="fn01_26">[ 26 ]</a></span>
                 Only 64-bit operating systems are supported; 32-bit systems are out.</p>
                
                <p class="standard">Reporting bugs on non-certified platforms can quickly be followed by a “sorry, that’s an unsupported platform, we won’t look at that further.” For Linux, for example, the Gentoo distribution is not on the list, so it would be “Not certified on Oracle VM.” Java can still run there, but a fix may not be pursued in the case of an error. Solaris SPARC is also no longer a certified platform.</p>
