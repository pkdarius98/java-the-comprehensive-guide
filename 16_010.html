        <p class="standard">The Java library provides a large number of classes and methods, but not always exactly what’s required by the current project. Some problems, such as the structure and configuration of Java projects, object-relational mappers (<span class="url"><a href="http://www.hibernate.org">www.hibernate.org</a></span>), or command-line parsers, may require various commercial or open-source libraries and frameworks. With purchased products, licensing issues are obvious, but with open-source products, integration into one’s own closed source project isn’t always a given. Various types of licenses (<span class="url"><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">https://opensource.org/licenses</a></span>) for open-source software with always different specifications—whether the source code is changeable, whether derivatives must also be free, whether mixing with proprietary software possible—complicate the choice, and violations (<span class="url"><a href="https://gpl-violations.org/">https://gpl-violations.org/</a></span>) are publicly denounced and unpleasant. Java developers should increasingly focus their attention on software under the Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD) license (the Apache license belongs in this group) and under the LGPL license for commercial distribution. The Apache group has assembled a nice collection of classes and methods named 
            <span class="italic">Apache Commons</span> (<span class="url"><a href="http://commons.apache.org">http://commons.apache.org</a></span>), and studying these sources are recommended for software developers. The website <span class="url"><a href="https://www.openhub.net">https://www.openhub.net</a></span> is exceptionally well suited for this purpose and enables searching via specific keywords through more than 1 billion source code lines of various programming languages—amazing how many developers use profanities! </p>
