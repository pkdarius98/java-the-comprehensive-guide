Millions of software developers worldwide make their living with the language, billions of devices run Java programs (e.g., all Blu-ray players). Every week, Oracle’s runtime environment is downloaded millions of times. In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to Java, discuss its features, compare it to other programming languages, and explore its platforms and development environments. </p><div class="imagebox figure-type"><a href="img-f1.1.html" id="f1.1"><img alt="Many Devices Speak Java" id="img-f1.1" src="bilderklein/klein01_001.png"/></a></div><p class="caption "><b>Figure 1.1</b>

        <h2 class="t2" id="h1.1">1.1    Historical Background</h2>
        
        <p class="standard">In the 1970s, when hippies were still dancing to the music of Jimi Hendrix, Bill Joy
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_00"/> wanted to create a programming language that would combine all the advantages of 
            <span class="italic">MESA</span>
            <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn01_01" id="fn01_01">[ 1 ]</a></span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_01"/> and 
            <span class="italic">C</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_02"/>. Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, was initially unable to fulfill this 
            <a id="p44"/>wish, and only in 1990s could he describe what a new object-oriented (OO) language might look like, in his article “Further.” For Joy, its basic principles should be based on C++
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_03"/>
        . Only later did he realize that C++ was unsuitable as a base language and too unwieldy for large programs.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">At that time, James Gosling
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_04"/> was working on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (
            <span class="italic">SGML</span>)
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_05"/>. He developed in C++ and wasn’t happy with this language either. The new language 
            <span class="italic">Oak</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_06"/> was born out of this displeasure. The name came to Gosling’s mind when he looked out the window and saw an 
            <span class="italic">oak</span> tree, but maybe that’s just a legend, because Oak also stands for 
            <span class="italic">Object Application Kernel</span>
        .</p>
        
        <p class="standard">Patrick Naughton
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_07"/> launched the Green project in December 1990
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_08"/>, involving Gosling and Mike Sheridan
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_09"/>. A remnant from the Green project is 
            <span class="italic">Duke</span>, which became a well-known symbol.

        <p class="standard">The idea behind this project was to develop software for interactive television and other consumer electronics devices. Components of this project were the operating system Green-OS
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_10"/>, Gosling’s interpreter Oak, and some hardware components. Joy showed the members of the Green project his “Further” essay and started implementing a graphical user interface (GUI). Gosling wrote the original compiler in C, and then Naughton, Gosling, and Sheridan designed the runtime interpreter in C as well. Ultimately, the C++ language was never used. Oak ran its first programs in August 1991. Thus, the Green dream team developed a device called *7
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_11"/> (
            <span class="italic">(Star Seven</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_12"/>), introduced internally in the fall of 1992. Former Sun CEO Scott McNealy
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_13"/> (who left the company after the Oracle acquisition in January 2010) was impressed with *7, and the team became First Person, Inc., in November of that year.
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_14"/>
         Now, it was a matter of marketing *7.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">In early 1993, the team heard
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_15"/> that Time Warner was looking for a system for set-top boxes
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_16"/>, which are electronic end-user devices that connect to a TV set. First Person turned its attention from the consumer market to set-top boxes. Unfortunately, Time Warner was later no longer interested, but First Person continued to develop. After many changes in direction, their development work focused on the 
            <span class="italic">world wide web</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_17"/>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_18"/>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_19"/> (referred to as the 
            <span class="italic">web</span> for short). The programming language was supposed to receive program code over the network, and faulty programs should not cause any damage. With this development, most concepts from C(++) could already be checked off—access 
            <a id="p45"/>via invalid pointers that wildly write to memory are one example. The members of the original project team realized that Oak had all the features required for use on the web—perfect, even though it had originally been developed for a completely different purpose. The Oak language was renamed 
            <span class="italic">Java</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_20"/> in 1994 because the name Oak was already registered by 
            <span class="italic">Oak Technology</span>. According to tradition, the decision for the name Java was made in a coffee shop. In Java, Patrick Naughton demonstrated a prototype of the 
            <span class="italic">WebRunner</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_21"/> browser, said to have been created over a single weekend. After minor revisions by Jonathan Payne,
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_22"/> the browser was christened 
            <span class="italic">HotJava</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_23"/> and presented to the public in May at SunWorld
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_24"/>
         ’95.</p>
        
        <p class="standard">At first, only a few users could make friends with HotJava. So, a truly fortunate moment occurred when Netscape decided to license the Java technology. Java was implemented in version 2.0 of 
            <span class="italic">Netscape Navigator</span>, which had launched in December 1995. On January 23, 1996, Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 was released, which for the first time provided a way to program Java applications and web applets
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_25"/> (with “applet
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_26"/>” defined as “a mini-application”). Shortly before the completion of JDK 1.0, the remaining members of the Green team founded the company 
            <span class="italic">JavaSoft</span>
            <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_27"/>
        , beginning Java’s triumphant progress.</p>

            <p class="standard first">Java was originally developed by Sun Microsystems
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_28"/>
            , a company with a long history in operating systems and hardware. Sun has laid many foundations for modern IT systems, but many are only familiar with it through Java.</p>
            
            <p class="standard last">Sun Microsystems never really fared that well as a company. Known and respected for its products, Sun lacked the skill to turn its products and services into cash. After major revenue losses, Oracle Corporation
                <a class="indexanchor" id="i01_29"/>
             acquired Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion, along with all rights and patents for Java, MySQL, Solaris, OpenOffice, VirtualBox, and other products. Oracle has since discontinued some open-source projects, but the large and commercially viable ones are still in good shape.</p>
