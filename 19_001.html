    Files and Data Streams</h1><p class="introductorynote indent_chapter_double">“Quick-wittedness is any answer that is so clever <br/>that the listener wishes he had given it.”<br/>—Elbert Green Hubbard (1856–1915)</p><p class="standard">Computers are so useful to us because they process data. The processing cycle begins with the 
        <span class="italic">reading</span> of the data, includes 
        <span class="italic">processing</span>, and ends with the 
        <span class="italic">output</span> of the data. This is called the 
        <span class="italic">IPO model</span> (input-process-output) in data processing systems. In the early days of IPO, inputs consisted of punch cards entered by system operators. Fortunately, those days are over. Nowadays, we store our data in 
        <span class="italic">files</span>
        <span class="footnote_anchor"><a href="footnotes.html#ftn-fn19_01" id="fn19_01">[ 224 ]</a></span>
     and databases. Note that a file is only interesting in its context; otherwise, it contains no information, and therefore, the view of a file is important. A program also consists of data and is often represented as a file.</p>

                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">File</samp> class since Java 1.0, which stands for a file or directory in the current file system. 
                <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">File</samp>

                            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">File</samp> class entirely. In the long run, the

                         object should no longer be expected.</p>

                            <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">File</samp> objects are still necessary if files are really to be represented on your own local file system and not independently of the file system like a ZIP file. A good example is
