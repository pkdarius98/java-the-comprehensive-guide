        <p class="standard">When large amounts of data are processed as strings, the question of optimization is quite relevant. The default implementation of the JDK only uses a simple search algorithm, which is rather inefficient for large patterns and search strings. In the field of search algorithms, however, computer science has produced interesting approaches in recent decades, for example, the optimal mismatch algorithm. However, the complete Unicode standard with 32 bits poses a certain problem. Enterprise libraries, for example, for parsing XML or JSON, don’t necessarily support the current Unicode standard with its hundreds of thousands of characters.</p>
