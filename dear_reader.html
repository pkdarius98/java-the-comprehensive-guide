            Dear Reader,
         </h1>
         
         
         <p class="standard">The first iteration of the book that you now hold in your hands was published for
            German readers in 2003. Today, that bestselling guide is in its 16
            <sup>th</sup>
            edition in Germany. What does it mean to write 16 editions of a book? Consider: reading
            your work repeatedly over the course of 20 years; expanding, rewriting, and refining,
            until you know the text like the back of your hand; evaluating changes to the topic
            area and sorting through hundreds of pages of text to implement the minutest updates
            to the Java language; reading, reviewing, and testing code snippets; and, of course,
            working through 16 editions of editor feedback and critique.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="standard">In many ways, this translation is a 17
            <sup>th</sup>
            edition, built on years of previous work. Christian Ullenboom has honed his manuscript
            once again, making key updates to ensure that this guide is the best resource for
            both new Java programmers and experienced professionals. And he’s done this in a new
            language, to bring his decades of knowledge to English readers. I’m certain that you
            will find his expertise invaluable. 
         </p>
